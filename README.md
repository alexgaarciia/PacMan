# PacMan
Development of a project related to PacMan. By constantly raising the difficulty and understanding the agent, we reached the goal of creating an intelligent pacman.
Please beware, there are several folders, each of them corresponding to different phases with different goals:
- Tutorial 1: Feature extraction and manual programming of an agent.
- Tutorial 2: Data preprocessing and classification using Weka Explorer.
- Tutorial 3: KnowledgeFlow and Experimenter Weka Interfaces.
- Tutorial 4: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning.
- Practice 1: Application of Machine Learning techniques to carry out prediction and classification tasks in the Pac-Man using Weka.
- Practice 2: Application of the Q-learning algorithm in the domain of the Pac-Man, to build an agent that works automatically in the greatest possible variety of labyrinths.
